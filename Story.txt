Once upon a time there was a monkey and two cats.
One day the two cats had a big fight on a chapati.
Suddenly the monkey came to solve their problem.
Monkey said,"Give this chapati to me. I will divide this chapati
into two equal halves."
The monkey divided the chapati and said, "I think one chapati
is smaller and other one is bigger. Let me take a bite from 
the bigger chapati."
